# Landscape

A surprisingly sophisticated and varied ASCII-style landscape generator. The
trick is that it generates a 3D voxel landscape then projects it to 2D
ASCII-style for display with some non-photorealistic rending stuff chucked in.

## TODO

- [ ] Standardize haze (use gradients for biome height mapping)
- [ ] Generalize tree detailing mechanism
- [ ] Add beach
- [ ] Add time of day
